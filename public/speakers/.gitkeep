# Speakers Images
This folder contains speaker profile images.

Naming convention:
- Use speaker IDs as filenames (e.g., 1.jpg, 2.jpg)
- Recommended image size: 300x300px or similar square aspect ratio
- Supported formats: jpg, png, webp

Current implementation uses lovable-uploads directory with custom uploaded images.
If a speaker image is not available, a fallback will be shown automatically.
